## About me
- Currently I'm a second-year Ph.D. candidate at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from Shandong University in 2021. 

## Research interests
My research focus lies in probability theory and its intersection with statistical physics, computer science, etc.
