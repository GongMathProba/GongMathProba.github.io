## About me
- Hello! Welcome to my homepage!
- I'm a 3rd-year Ph.D. student of [ProbabilityGroup@PKU](https://pkuprobability.com)  at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University.
- I received my bachelor's degree (with an honored degree) in Statistics (GPA ranked 1st/132) from Department of Mathematics, Shandong University in 2021.
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eVymvlkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)
- My [Erd&#337;s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős_number) is 3.

## Curriculum Vitae 
- [CV](https://GongMathProba.github.io/CV.pdf), last updated on April 1st, 2024.

## Research Interests
My research interest is probability theory, and its intersection with statistics, statistical physics and theoretical computer science. Currently, I mainly work on probability theory in high-dimensional settings.

## Papers
- [The Umeyama algorithm for matching correlated Gaussian geometric models in the low-dimensional regime.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15095) (with Zhangsong Li), _submitted_.
- [The algorithmic phase transition of random graph alignment problem.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06590) (with [Hang Du](https://hangdu2000.github.io/MyHomePage/) and Rundong Huang), _submitted_.
- A polynomial-time approximation scheme for the maximal overlap of two independent Erd&#337;s-Rényi graphs. (with [Jian Ding](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/dingjian/index.html) and [Hang Du](https://hangdu2000.github.io/MyHomePage/)), _Random Structures and Algorithms_. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07823), [journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rsa.21212).
