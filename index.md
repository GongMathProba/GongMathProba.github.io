## About me
- Currently I'm a 3rd-year Ph.D. student of [ProbabilityGroup@PKU](https://pkuprobability.com)  at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University.
- I received my bachelor's degree (with an honored degree) in Statistics (GPA ranked 1st/132) from Shandong University in 2021.

## Curriculum Vitae 
- [CV](https://GongMathProba.github.io/CV_Shuyang.pdf), last updated on Jan. 10, 2024.

## Research Interests
My research focus is probability theory and its intersection with statistical physics, combinatorics, statistics and theoretical computer science.

## Papers
- The Umeyama algorithm for matching correlated Gaussian geometric models in the low-dimensional regime. (with Z. Li), _in progress_.
- [The algorithmic phase transition of random graph alignment problem.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06590) (with [H.Du](https://hangdu2000.github.io/MyHomePage/) and R.Huang), _submitted_.
- [A polynomial-time approximation scheme for the maximal overlap of two independent Erd\H{o}s-Rényi graphs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07823) (with [J.Ding](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/dingjian/index.html) and [H.Du](https://hangdu2000.github.io/MyHomePage/)), to appear in _Random Structures and Algorithms_.
